Narrative:
In order to have more understandable scenarios
As a application user
I want to be able to create composite steps
Lifecycle:
Before:
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen

Scenario: Can create new composites
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
Then File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
When Web user clicks the element saveComposites
Then File composites/@className.groovy exists

Scenario: Can revert changes
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given I can modify the composite to the element compositeText
When Web user clicks the element revertComposites
Then Web element className should NOT have text Given I can modify the composite

Scenario: Can delete composites class
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user clicks the element deleteComposites
When Web user clicks the element ok
Then File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist

Scenario: Can update existing composites
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given I can update composites to the element compositeText

Scenario: Can NOT revert changes when composites are unchanged
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Then Web element revertComposites is disabled

Scenario: Can NOT delete new composites class before it is saved for the first time
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
Then Web element deleteComposites is NOT visible

Scenario: Can NOT save composites when there are validation errors
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user clears the element compositeText
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Can NOT save when composites are unchanged
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Can not modify the name of an existing composites class
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Then Web element className is disabled
