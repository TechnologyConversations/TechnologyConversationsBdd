Narrative:
In order to have more understandable scenarios
As a application user
I want to be able to create composite steps
Lifecycle:
Before:
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen

Scenario: Composites class name is required
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user clears the element className
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Composite is required
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user clears the element compositeText
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Composite must start with Given, When or Then
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value This text does not start with Given, When or Then to the element compositeText
Then Web element compositeTextError should have text Step must start with Given, When or Then words.
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Composite step is required
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user clears the element compositeStep1
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Composite step must start with Given, When or Then
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value This text does not start with Given, When or Then to the element compositeStep1
Then Web element compositeStepsError should have text All steps must start with Given, When or Then words.
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Scenario: Composite must use valid parameters naming
Examples:
When Web user sets value <step> to the element compositeText
When Web user clicks the element saveComposites
Then Web element errorText should have text <errorText>

|step|errorText|
|Given there is param <with space>|with space is incorrect|
|Given there is param <1IsNotAGoodStart>|1IsNotAGoodStart is incorrect|

Example: {step=Given there is param <with space>, errorText=with space is incorrect}
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value Given there is param <with space> to the element compositeText
When Web user clicks the element saveComposites
Then Web element errorText should have text with space is incorrect

Example: {step=Given there is param <1IsNotAGoodStart>, errorText=1IsNotAGoodStart is incorrect}
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value Given there is param <1IsNotAGoodStart> to the element compositeText
When Web user clicks the element saveComposites
Then Web element errorText should have text 1IsNotAGoodStart is incorrect


Scenario: Composites class name must be valid
Examples:
When Web user sets value <classNameValue> to the element className
Then Web element classNameError should have text Class name cannot start with a number, but after the initial character it may use any combination of letters and digits, underscores or dollar signs.
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

|classNameValue|
|1IsNotAGoodStart|
|space is not allowed|

Example: {classNameValue=1IsNotAGoodStart}
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value 1IsNotAGoodStart to the element className
Then Web element classNameError should have text Class name cannot start with a number, but after the initial character it may use any combination of letters and digits, underscores or dollar signs.
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled

Example: {classNameValue=space is not allowed}
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user sets value space is not allowed to the element className
Then Web element classNameError should have text Class name cannot start with a number, but after the initial character it may use any combination of letters and digits, underscores or dollar signs.
Then Web element saveComposites is disabled


Scenario: Composite must contain at least one step
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1
When Web user clicks the element removeCompositeStep1
Then Web element compositeStepsError should have text At least one step must be defined.
