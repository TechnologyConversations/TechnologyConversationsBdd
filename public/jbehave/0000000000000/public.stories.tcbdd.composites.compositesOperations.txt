Narrative:
In order to have more understandable scenarios
As a application user
I want to be able to create composite steps
Lifecycle:
Before:
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen

Scenario: Can create new composites
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened
Given Web page is refreshed
Given Web user is in the New Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestComposites
Given File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened (FAILED)
(org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure.

Given Web page is refreshed (NOT PERFORMED)
When Web user sets value Given this class has at least one Composite to the element compositeText (NOT PERFORMED)
When Web user sets value Given variable $key has value $value to the element compositeStep1 (NOT PERFORMED)
Then File composites/@className.groovy does NOT exist (NOT PERFORMED)
When Web user clicks the element saveComposites (NOT PERFORMED)
Then File composites/@className.groovy exists (NOT PERFORMED)

Scenario: Can revert changes
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
Given Web address /page/composites/@className.groovy is opened (FAILED)

Driver info: driver.version: PhantomJSDriver)
Given Web page is refreshed (NOT PERFORMED)
When Web user sets value Given I can modify the composite to the element compositeText (NOT PERFORMED)
When Web user clicks the element revertComposites (NOT PERFORMED)
Then Web element className should NOT have text Given I can modify the composite (NOT PERFORMED)

Scenario: Can delete composites class
Given Web user is in the View Composites screen
Given variable className has value TestViewComposites
When File is copied from test/mocks/@className.groovy.tmpl to composites/@className.groovy
